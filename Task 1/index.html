            <h2>Welcome to Kodagu!</h2>
            <p>Coorg in Karnataka is known as the Scotland of India.
               A district with unique culture of its own, this verdant landscape has been eulogised by many an acclaimed personality in vivid terms.
               It is also known as Kodagu, and is famous for its exquisite climate, hill ranges, and coffee plantations.
               It resembles Scotland in terms of climate, terrain, architecture, and waterfalls.</p>

            <h2 class="Titletext">Mandalapatti hills!</h2>
            <p class="text">Mandalpatti is a magnificent and unique site in Coorg, Karnataka, overlooking the grasslands of Pushpagiri forests in the Western Ghats.
                Nature is a wonderful thing. It reminds of the fact that even amid all the tension, the world is a beautiful place. 
                Neelakurinji — also known as Strobilanthes kunthiana — blooming in Mandalpatti Hills in Karnataka’s Kodagu district is proof.
                The plant belongs to the genus Strobilanthes which, it is said, was first scientifically described by Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck in the 19th century.
                It is said that these flowers bloom once every 12 years. They belong to a shrub found in the Shola forests of the Western Ghats in the states of Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Interestingly, Nilgiri Hills, which means ‘blue hills’, get their name from the bluish-purplish flowers that are Neelakurinji.</p>

            <p class="text">The Kurinji flowers grow at an altitude of 1,300 to 2,400 metres.
                 While the shrub is usually 30 to 60 cm high, it can grow well beyond 180 cm, too, under congenial conditions.
                 The Kurinji Flowers at Kodagu have grown after 12 years. The flowers were first spotted around early August when the entire region was covered by a purple blanket of flowers.
                 In the days following, more Hills will be covered by these rare flowers. The site is expected to remain till the end of September.</p>
